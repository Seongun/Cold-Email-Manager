## Case 1:

John is a senior at NYUAD, wants to apply to jobs through cold email.
He wants to send out cold email to fifty startups whose email address he has compiled in an excel sheet beforehand.

Being a senior, he wants to minimize the time it takes for him to send out email to individual companies. As such, all he does for each company is to just swap out name of the company and their address from a pre-composed email template before sending the email.

He wants to be able to do this with a little bit of configuration and a click of a button, so that he can spend more time on his Capstone.


## Case 2:

Jane is a student who has applied to around thirty jobs this application season.
She is laborious in all her works, and keeps a meticulous excel sheet of when the last contact from a company was.
However, it is quite bothersome for her to manually search through her inbox and determine whether the right time has come to follow up on those emails every time there is an update. 

She wants to be able to manage her ongoing applications easily -- to be able to be notified when it has been more than 2 weeks since she last contacted a recruiter. In fact, she would like it even more if she could, given the option of companies she could respond to, send out a bulk message containing same
email content to all the companies she needs to follow up on.
