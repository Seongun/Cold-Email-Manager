# Cold-Email-Manager
A standalone Python application to revolutionize excel-based cold email management 


## About this project
This project is about helping forgetful people keep in better touch with important connections in their lives, especially in the context of job application. 

In the hectical nature of Senior year job application season, some have to keep track of hundreds of contacts in excel and manually copy paste essentially similar emails, follow up, and update their dates of last contact, etc. This process is highly repetitive, and "people" often eff up in senseless ways such as sending email meant for a company to another. This tragedy can be easily addressed.
